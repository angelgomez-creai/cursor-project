# Backend Rules

- Validate inputs at boundaries (HTTP, queue, jobs).
- Principle of least privilege for DB and services.
- Log with structure (level, event, correlationId).

## API
- Version endpoints; never break existing clients.
- Consistent error model with traceable codes.

## Database
- Migrations are idempotent and reversible.
- Use transactions for multi-step writes.
